## Overview
Not a very difficult challenge, it's a newbie level challenge.
There's not much changing from the mobile design, so creating a responsive design was quite easy

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
As always, I begin with analysis of both designs, identifying the breakpoints,i.e., how transitioning will happen from one device to another. Then, I lay the foundation with html. Then later on, I add the styling

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As always, I am continuing to grow my knowledge with basic designs.
I have learned how to use the nth child selector and also how to add, simple overlays

### Continued development

I want to continue putting my css skills to the test, and to also work on harder designs, with js, in order to improve my web development skills
